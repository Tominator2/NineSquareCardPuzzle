# NineSquareCardPuzzle

This is a Java program I wrote to find solutions to a Where's Wally (a.k.a. "Where's Waldo" in the US) nine square card puzzle.

Each of the nine cards features the top or bottom halves of four characters: Wally (Waldo), Wanda, Wizard Whitebeard, or Woof.  To solve the puzzle you must place all 9 cards in a square so that all of the neighbouring sides have matching tops and bottoms.  There are nine cards and each card has four possible orientations so the number of possible layouts to search is 9! x 4<sup>9</sup> = 95,126,814,720 layouts!
